# Bash course by ysap.sh

This repo is a part of some sort of my learning documentation. This one is specifcally for notes from bash course delivered to us by Eddy from ysap.sh.

Kudos to him for releasing this great video.

Full course: course.ysap.sh


## Structure

There is separate folder for each lesson I found intersting which contains bash script made along the way and the markdown files with some notes.
